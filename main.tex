\section{Menger's Theorem}
\begin{definition}
G is k connected iff for all u,v $\in V_{G}$ there exist k disjoint paths from u to v.\\
Disjoint suggests that there will be no shared vertices except ends.

%Let X and Y be simplicial complexes. A simplicial map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a pair of functions:
%\centerline {$f_v: V_X \rightarrow V_Y$ and $f_S: S_X \rightarrow S_Y$}

%where $f_S(\sigma) = \{ f_V(u): u \in \sigma \}$
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    G is bipartite iff it contains no odd length cycles.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof idea]
  
\end{proof}
  
\begin{definition}
    A forest is a graph that contains no cycles.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A connected forest is called a tree.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    A connected graph is a tree iff it contains no {$C_3$} minor.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof idea:]
    Edge contraction. \\
    
\end{proof}
Based on the preimages of the {$C_3$} minor we can backtrack to where this might have originated from.

\begin{text}
{\textbf{Claim:} Given a tree and two vertices, u,v $\in V_{T}$ there exists a unique path u to v in T.}   
\end{text}

\begin{text}
{\textbf {Question: }Prove that no tree is 2 connected.}
    \begin{proof}
        Bla Bla Bla....       
    \end{proof}
\end{text}
\begin{text}
{\textbf {Corollary: }Removal of an edge in a tree will separate the graph.}
    \begin{proof}
        Bla Bla Bla....       
    \end{proof}
\end{text}
\begin{definition}
A leaf \footnote{A \textbf{star} has (n-1) leaves and a \textbf{path} has 2 leaves} of a tree (graph) is a degree 1 vertex. On separating leaf we are still left with a connected graph.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Every tree with atleast 2 vertices has atleast 2 leaves.
    \begin{proof}[Proof idea:]
        Path is a minor of a tree. \\
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
\begin{text}
{\textbf {Question: }Prove every forest is bipartite}
    \begin{proof}
        Bla Bla Bla....       
    \end{proof}
\end{text}
\begin{text}
{\textbf {Question: }How many edges can a tree with n vertices have?}
    \begin{proof}[Solution: ]
        A tree with n vertices has (n-1) edges.       
    \end{proof}
    {\textbf {Note: }A forest will have atmost (n-1) edges.}
    
\end{text}
